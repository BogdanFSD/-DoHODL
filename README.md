 # #DoHODL 

 ![](img/mock_up.png)


 ## Purpose of the Project

 **#DoHODL** this is an explanational and educational modern community that tries to explain Who? Why? How? I created a site to give more information for people of all ages to shift their undestanding of this technology (or at least will try to).
 Look of the website should be open, friendly, intuitive, responsive at all devices as cryptoassets. Ecourage people to contribute for this relatively small but powerfull instrument.  

 Website should be able to provide all information that user might expect to see at such specific theme and leave good aftertaste in terms of design and user experience
