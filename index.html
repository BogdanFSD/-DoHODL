            <p> "HODL" by itself means - <u>Hold On for Dear Life</u>.And as you may guess it was misspelling due to
                price
                swing and the author was influenced by a glass of whiskey during that period. And became well known
                among
                crypto-community in general. This represents the way of trading in the crypto-world that can bring you

                is
                digital. There are two main types hot and cold wallets: <br>- Hot wallet you use at the trading

            <p>Long story short NFT - is a non-fungible token. Bitcoin on the instance is fungible which means that you
                can
                trade one bitcoin and receive the completely same thing. While with NFT completely different story. It
                is a
                one-of-a-kind thing that might have. If you would exchange it for something totally different like you
                give a
                card and receive car instead (good deal).
